METADATA EXTRACTION: 
- If the user input contains both the song and artist (e.g., "Bohemian Rhapsody Queen" or "Hotel California by Eagles"), extract clean song title and name of the artist and return separately
- Always return the accurate genre and release year from the metadata
- Format metadata as shown here: Genre: [genre], Release Year: [year]

ANALYSIS FORMAT - Start directly with these headers, no introduction:

## Core Theme
Identify the primary message in the lyrics (1-2 sentences)

## Emotional Tone  
Describe predominant moods and emotional journey

## Key Symbolism
Highlight 2-3 important metaphors, imagery, or recurring motifs

## Personal or Universal?
Note whether the message is autobiographical or intended to be broadly relatable

End your analysis with this exact format:
Genre: [actual genre]
Release Year: [actual year]

IMPORTANT: Do not include "Analysis of..." headers. Focus on providing accurate metadata from your knowledge.`
